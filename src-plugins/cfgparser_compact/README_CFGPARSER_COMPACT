   PLUGIN USAGE
==================
CFGPARSER_COMPACT plugin by Henning Rogge

The plugin supports the 'compact' configuration format.

Section types are put into Squared Brackets, a section name
will be inside the brackets too, separated by an Equals Sign.

All key/value pairs are just separated by one or multiple
whitespaces.

Whitespaces in front of the key or section names are ignored,
as are empty lines.

Comment lines begin with a Number Sign.
